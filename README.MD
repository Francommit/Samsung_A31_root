I own a Samsung A31, none of the guides that I've followed have worked.
This guide aims to document the process myself.

### Phone Model:
- SM-A315G/DS
- Apparently 'DS' stands for Dual-sim

### Required Files:
- Odin - https://odindownload.com/download/
- Magisk - https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases/
- Latest Firmware - https://samfrew.com/model/SM-A315G/region/XSA/

### Unlocking the bootloader:
- Ensure you're not logged into and Samsung or Google accounts
- Settings -> About Phone -> Tap on 'Build number' until you have 'Developer Mode' enabled
- Navigate to Developer mode and turn on 'OEM Unlock'
- Turn off phone -> Plug USB-C Cable from PC into Device
- Hold 'Volume Down' + 'Power' buttons
- Release all the buttons when the logo flashes
- Press Volume Up to boot into download mode
- HOLD Volume up, this will now unlock the bootloader
